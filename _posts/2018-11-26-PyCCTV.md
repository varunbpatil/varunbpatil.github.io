#### 'Person' detection using Yolo V3 in Keras.

Let us look at how to easily detect a person in an image using Yolo V3 in Keras.

Note that Yolo V3 can also localize the object in the image for us, but we're
not interested in it. All we are interested in is knowing whether a person
is present in the image or not. We are not concerned with where in the image
the person is present.

The following Python class is all we need.

```python
class YoloV3:
    """
    A Yolo V3 "person" detection implementation in Keras.

        new_image.paste(image, ((w - nw)//2, (h - nh)//2))
        return new_image

        image_data /= 255.
        image_data = np.expand_dims(image_data, axis=0)

        #
        # "person" is the first of the 80 classes (COCO dataset).
        obj_conf_pos = [4, 89, 174]
        person_cls_pos = [5, 90, 175]

        for pred in predictions:
            x, y = pred.shape[1:3]
            pred = pred[0]
            
            for i in range(x):
                for j in range(y):
                    for (obj, person) in zip(obj_conf_pos, person_cls_pos):

                           self._sigmoid(pred[i, j, person]) > self.threshold:
                            return True

        return False
```


Let us investigate some of the methods in greater detail.


The `__init__` method loads the pretrained Keras Yolo V3 model from disk.
This particular model was trained on the [COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/#home)
containing 80 classes of which 'person' is one of the classes.


The `_resize_image` method is responsible for resizing the image to a dimension
suitable for feeding into the Yolo V3 model.


The `_predict` method does exactly that. It runs a forward pass through the Yolo V3
model and returns the predictions made by the model on the given image.


To read more about the structure of the Yolo V3 model and how to interpret the
predictions returned by the Yolo V3 model, there are excellent resources
[here](https://towardsdatascience.com/yolo-v3-object-detection-53fb7d3bfe6b)
and [here](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/implement-yolo-v3-object-detector-pytorch-part-1.html).


The `contains_person` method checks whether there is a "person" class detected anywhere
in the given image from the prediction that the Yolo V3 model returned for that image.


The Yolo V3 model returns 3 different predictions at different scales. Each of these
are responsible for predicting objects of small, medium or big size in the image.
The shapes of the returned predictions are - (1, 13, 13, 255), (1, 26, 26, 255), (1, 52, 52, 255).
The second and third shape indices refer to the grids. The last index contains the
prediction for that grid. There are `3 anchor boxes` and `85 predicted values per anchor box`
for a `total of 85 * 3 = 255` predicted values per grid cell. 

What are the 85 predicted values per anchor box, you ask ? The `first four are the box
coordinates and dimensions` (which we don't need in our application). The `fifth is the
object confidence` (confidence that an object has been detected in that grid cell). The
`last 80 are the class confidences` for the 80 classes of the COCO dataset ("person" is
the first class).


Note that unlike previous versions of Yolo, there is no softmax over the class confidences.
In fact, the object confidences and class confidences are not in the range 0-1 in Yolo V3.
The values will have to be passed through the `_sigmoid` method which will then return values
in the range 0-1.

#### Getting images from webcam and remote monitoring using a Flask web server

Let us build a class to perform the following 2 tasks:

1. Continuously capture frames from the webcam.
   Check whether a person is present in the image.
   If yes, save the image to disk for future analysis.

3. Create a web server that will allow us to remotely monitor the webcam
   for a "person" in its field of view over Wi-Fi.


```python
class PyCCTV:
    """
    A CCTV camera application with "person" detection and
    remote monitoring over Wi-Fi.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, model, output):
        # Cleanup the output directory.
        shutil.rmtree(output, ignore_errors=True)
        if not os.path.exists(output):
            os.makedirs(output)

        self.model = model
        self.output = output


    def _web_server(self, output, image_num):
        """
        Flask web server for remote monitoring of webcam over Wi-Fi.
        """
        app = Flask("PyCCTV")

        @app.route('/')
        def index():
            return "Welcome to PyCCTV!"

        def read_image_from_disk():
            disk_image_name = "image_%05d.jpg" % (image_num.value - 1,)
            disk_image_path = os.path.join(output, disk_image_name)
            if os.path.exists(disk_image_path):
                im = cv2.imread(disk_image_path)
                return cv2.imencode('.jpg', im)[1].tobytes()

        @app.route('/image.jpg')
        def generate_response():
            return Response(read_image_from_disk(), mimetype='image/jpeg')

        app.run(host='0.0.0.0')


    def _webcam(self, model, output, image_num):
        """
        Continuously capture frames from the webcam and detect the presence
        of a person in the frame using Yolo V3.
        """        
        yolo = YoloV3(model)

        while True:
            cam = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # ls /sys/class/video4linux

            # Hardware defaults for Lenovo T440s
            cam.set(3, 1280)           # Width
            cam.set(4, 720)            # Height
            cam.set(10, 128/255)       # Brightness (max = 255)
            cam.set(11, 32/255)        # Contrast (max = 255)
            cam.set(12, 64/100)        # Saturation (max = 100)
            cam.set(13, 0.5)           # Hue (0 = -180, 1 = +180)

            # Read a frame from the webcam.
            ret, image = cam.read()
            cam.release()

            if not ret:
                raise Exception('Camera module not operational')

            # Convert from cv2 to PIL image.
            cv2_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
            pil_image = Image.fromarray(cv2_image)

            # If the frame contains a person, save it to disk.
            if yolo.contains_person(pil_image):
                disk_image_name = "image_%05d.jpg" % (image_num.value,)
                disk_image_path = os.path.join(output, disk_image_name)
                cv2.imwrite(disk_image_path, image)
                image_num.value += 1


    def run(self):
        """

        """

        # Shared variable to keep track of the most recent image.

        #                 the presence of a person in the frame.
        # 2. web_server - A Flask web server for remote monitoring over Wi-Fi.
        processes = []

        processes.append(Process(target=self._webcam,
                                 args=(self.model, self.output, image_num)))
        processes.append(Process(target=self._web_server,
                                 args=(self.output, image_num)))

        for p in processes:
            p.daemon = True
            p.start()

        # Gracefully handle Ctrl-C.
        try:
            for p in processes:
                p.join()
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            for p in processes:
                p.terminate()
```


Let us walk through the methods in greater detail.

The `__init__` method prepares the output directory to store frames captured
from the webcam that contain a "person" in them. Since we store, only images
that contain a person in them, we are saving a lot of space.

The `run` method is responsible for launching to sub-processes - one process that
`continuously captures frames from the webcam and checks to see if a person is in the
frame` and another process that implements the `web server using Flask`.

The `_webcam` method is the one which continuously captures frames from the webcam
and uses the Yolo V3 model to predict whether a person is in the frame. If yes,
the frame is stored to disk at the user specified location.

The `_web_server` method implements the Flask web-server for real-time
remote monitoring of the webcam over home Wi-Fi. All it does is read the most
recent image (containing a person) from the disk and serves it as a jpeg image 
over the web which `can be viewed remotely over any mobile device`.

Now, all that is needed to run our CCTV application is to instantiate an object
of the PyCCTV class and call the run() method on that object.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":

    # Argument parser.
    ap = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    ap.add_argument("-m", "--model", required=True,
                    help="path to yolo v3 model")
    ap.add_argument("-o", "--output", required=True,
                    help="path to output image directory")
    args = vars(ap.parse_args())


    # Start the PyCCTV application.
    cctv = PyCCTV(args['model'], args['output'])
    cctv.run()
```
